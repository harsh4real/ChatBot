Django Tutorials
================

These are mini tutorials designed to introduce basic parts of Django in a way that is quick and brief yet easy to understand. For a more comprehensive explanation, see the tutorial in Django's official documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/

There are three tutorials in this collection. The first one is a basic introduction to Django, and the second one builds on the first to introduce another common library used alongside Django; `Django REST framework`_. The third tutorial continues by configuring the ``django-filter`` package to filter results from the API built in part 2.
